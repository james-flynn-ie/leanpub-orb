  A tag-based book workflow. A subset preview is triggered for every
  commit (I keep my Subset.txt including the whole book, so I can
  quickly preview the PDF after each change, but you could also
  include the current chapter, for example). When a commit is tagged
  with something starting with "preview", a full preview is triggered
  (which produces all the formats supported by Leanpub). Finally,
  publication of the book is supported by two types of tags: those
  starting with "silent-publish" trigger a publish without sending
  release notes; and those starting with "publish" publish the book,
  sending out release notes to readers of the book. The text of the
  release notes is taken from either the tag message, or the commit
  message of the tagged commit.
